## Technologies used

This webapp was created with the help of following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Jest, Enzyme (testing)
- Git and GitHub (version control)

## Features

**Redmini** means **Red**dit in **mini**mal site!\
This webapp gives you the simplest features to interact with Reddit. With it you can search and read posts in categories.\
Redmini sticks with its name, which is focus on a mini UI, enough for you to read posts and comments from Reddit.\
Also, it works perfectly on multiple devices, from computer to mobile phone. Especially, in *Android*, you can just pin Redmini to main screen to make it a normal application.

## Future work

I am still working everyday to bring more features to Redmini without making it lost the major track: **minimal Reddit**.
